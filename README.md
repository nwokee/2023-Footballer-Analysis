Like in every sport, statistics and data have made their way into the worldwide game of soccer, and year by year, using numbers and using them accurately can be the difference between not only winning games but winning trophies. However, from a spectator's point of view, using numbers to figure out how a team can improve doesn't mean much. What's more important for fans is being able to use numbers to back up claims and agendas they may or may not make while watching games. These different viewpoints all build towards the end of the season, where fans, the media, and even the players get into extensive debates about who the best and worst performers of the season are. While stats play a part, almost all final decisions for awards and nominations come down to human decisions, which can be heavily biased. For this project, I wanted to see what it would take for an algorithm to decide who the season's best performers were. 



The data for this project was taken from the following Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20222023-football-player-stats

The data cleaning process was done by hand in Excel, and all visuals and statistics were generated using R.

Along with my presentation, report, data, and code is the rubric for the assignment, as this was our final for our CSC 201 Data Science class.
